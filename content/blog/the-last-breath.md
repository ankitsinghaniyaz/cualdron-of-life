It is said that we are ignorant and we have stopped thinking about the inevitable end but I think we haven't. Instead, I believe we understand it's certainty and we avoid spending energy thinking about it. We know that an end will come but we don't like to imagine when or how painful it would be to die but we are sure that it will.

Grief is a natural response to a personal loss. When you lose someone who is never going to come back the same way it can be devastating. Death hurts and grief is a natural response to it. Shed tears, dump your heart out and do everything that needs to be done. Such a loss can be shared with other loved ones, who are grieved by your grief. Lucky are those who have someone around them who can share their grief, otherwise, to the world, it's all a mocking game, generally. Blessed are those who feel pained from the pain of others. They are the saviours, saving this world from becoming an orphanage. Only this true care for another being is what makes a family otherwise everyone is selfish to some degree and then what else should I call this world if not an orphanage.

I sometimes see life as a given number of breaths or a given number of heartbeats. Every second when our heart pumps and we leave a breath out we are one step closer to exhausting the gas in our machine. I've seen living being leave their last breath never to inhale again. It is scary and mind-opening at the same time. If you are reminded that your tank is getting emptier every breath how conscious would we be to use it? Every move and every step would be calculated towards peace and joy and away from drama and conflicts. You would carry hurt to lesser distances, hug more people on the path and forgive so much more often.

We don't know if the one breath we are going to leave now is our last or how far are we in our journey. Life only gives hint on the amount of gas left in your machine. You might just run out and not even realise. I want to be joyous when I take that last breath. I should be ecstatic and happy about everything that I've done. No breaking of hearts, not hurting anyone on purpose and living a life of moderation in everything. Take care and bring awareness to your every breath. ðŸ˜ƒ
