I wonder if you too are afraid of uncertainties? It is very easy to dream but the hard work it takes to make it a reality is not insignificant. The fear that things may not turn out as I think they should, stops me from putting in the hard work. Is this an excuse? I get thoughts that wait for the right idea where success is guaranteed. This idea is very lucrative and saves me from doing any real work right now. Isn't this situation similar to the saying:

> Try and you may fail, don't try and you will fail for sure

I waste time watching anime, movies and what not. The sense of pride that keeps moving me is that I do it less than others. What a sense of superiority? My stupid self-doesn't even want to understand that what others do is theirs to care, what I do is my *karma*. 

Understanding all this play of thoughts is one thing but how to fix them? I am sure there should be a way. I would like to ask you a question, are you afraid too of doing things you want to but are not sure about the outcome? It could be a new job, a new style of life or anything for that matter. Have you found a way to solve this? I would love to talk about this if you have had a similar problem and have had the guts to go beyond. It doesn't matter if you fail or succeed in the end. The main part is that you attempted, you took the risk, you took the effort. 

>, In the end, it's only the chances we didn't take that we regret

One more question, do you also like me feel that most of your sentences start with an I? Is this being selfish in my speech or this is just a lame thought? :')

In my head I've some ideas, there is a way I want to live my life. But the comfort of confirming with what everyone do holds me back. The care for my family that I have to earn a living holds me back. Sometimes, I feel that all these are the stories I am telling myself to keep me in the comfort where I am.

Still looking for some clarity, I hope I have the courage to live the life the way it is supposed to be. Pray that I have the strength to live my life to the fullest. :)
