When I pondered about my likes and then about the likes of some of my closest people. It soon dawned upon me that we don't like much. I would challenge you to take one minute pause and think of 3 things you like? I'm confident that you are going to have a hard time listing even three of them. When someone like me tries to itemize them, they come up with travel, sleep and hangout(~hangover).

It soon became apparent that these are the things that I've done the most. So is it that we eventually start to like anything we do for a long time? Is it the reason why we like that toxic person as we have spent so much of our time with them? I do not know.

Can we also say that we have not found our likings yet? Have we not experimented enough in life? Have we not explored much? Are we living in the right way? The questions are going to spin in the back of my head for some time but here are a few things that I do seem to understand.

The thing we call passion, I feel, is a product of liking something obsessively. Like something so madly that it burns a fire inside, which drives your body in every possible way trying to achieve the subject of your desire. Mix this fire with negativity and it soon turns black into envy and jealousy.

Also see that when I say _like_ I equally refer to the other half of like, the hate. When I hate something, it's just that I do not like that thing. The feeling of like is still the key. Like to have it or like not to have it, the chemicals are the same. I just happen to think of a self-help video I've seen on the internet. It speaks about our brain's inability to comprehend the word NOT. So when I say this is not an elephant. The brain still processes the idea of an elephant and then rejects it. An interesting subject which I do not completely comprehend myself.

The bright side is if we are still not sure about what we like, we need to collect and move our ass and see where your likes might be hiding. :)
