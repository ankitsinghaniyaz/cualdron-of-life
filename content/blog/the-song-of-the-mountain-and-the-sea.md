While you climb the mountain, <br>
I tread the beach. <br>
While you pick the flower, <br>
I clear the weed. <br>
While you protect me from the cold, <br>
I fight the heat. <br>
While you shower the love, <br>
I make the ends meet. <br>
While you see the stars, <br>
I like to sleep. <br>
While you touch my arms, <br>
I kiss your lips. <br>
While you push me forward, <br>
I don't let you fall deep. <br>
While you snap at me, <br>
I sound the bleep. <br>
While you clean the house, <br>
I clear utensils. <br>
While you sing the prayer, <br>
I turn the beads. <br>
While you go to work, <br>
I stay amiss, <br>
While you suffer the pain, <br>
I feel trist. <br>
While you instil discipline, <br>
I spoil the kids. <br>
While you play the music, <br>
I do the leads. <br>
While you do your hairs, <br>
I find the clips. <br>
While you fight the tears, <br>
I kill the pricks. <br>
While you're with me, <br>
I'll always be me! :) <br>
