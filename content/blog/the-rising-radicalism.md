We are all opinionated and most of the time these opinions are not our own. They are thrusted into our consciousness by the people around us, the media and the general ideology of the society. I believe opinions are neutral just like smartphones which are neither bad nor good on their own. There are other sources of opinion like from books, family and friends. What I'm trying to get at it is that there are varied sources of opinions and it differs for each individual.

Today as I look around myself I see radicalism in every sphere of life. Let's take an example of rising divide based on religion in India, where I'm a citizen. Today people have unknown agitation and distrust towards the Muslims. The Muslims are in a state of discomfort and anguish. I know not what are the seeds of this feeling but I find myself and every one of us equally responsible for the state we are in. I have a view that majority of Indian are gullible and simple beings. So the political regimes have instilled such ideas into the head of a common man he doesn't even know what he speaks of. He speaks of some broken twisted facts which he acquired through social media, which is always a lie. He bases his convictions on some reasoning which is invalid and unproven. People have been presented with the one side of the coin. Just like one side of the moon never receives the light.

I don't know why I'm talking about this. I don't know if this affects me directly, but I care about my nation and therefore about the people who make it the nation. In my nation, I see all religions as equal. All men were created equal with the same red blood I have, with the set of organs I have.

I know my attempt may be futile and go unnoticed and unheard. I write to myself when the time will be dark and remember what my true opinions were. The time is almost here, we are seeing this kind of sentiments in all the divides. Let it be racism, feminism, sexism or anything for that matter. People are without doubt believing that they have been deprived of some right which they were supposedly entitled to.

In this world which is autonomous and governed by the laws of nature. How can someone change or do things that will fundamentally affect your right and existence? We have been made to believe that something that was ours has been taken from us. In feminism, the right of female equality is the matter of loss. In case of caste divide the past looting, plunders and abuse the cause of dismay. I question this! Has there been any rule or any system where some part of the society was not at a disadvantage? We are humans and not God, so we don't have such power to treat everyone equal and be just to each and everything in the existence and we should not expect it from others as well.

This is not to say that I'm not against the abuse women are facing or for the matter how some sect or caste or colour has been deprived of their rights and privileges. I am completely up for equality and justice. What I don't like is the wrong use of our sentiments. We are all hurt and want justice and there are shrewd people out there who are willing to manipulate us to gain power and possessions. We all need to keep this in mind.

Listen to the griefs of others. Understand their pain. If they are hurt and have resentment against someone probe them and understand why they blame that particular someone. You should mostly find the person doesn't have enough justification and reasons to say why the other person is wrong and to be blamed. It is mostly an influenced thought.

This is the time we live in! What I pray and hope for my country and my earth is that we all come together, understand our differences and forgive our fellow beings. I know the hurt can be real and to let it go can be difficult but what I know is holding back a grudge will never let us move ahead be a better person. I wish for the peace. :)
