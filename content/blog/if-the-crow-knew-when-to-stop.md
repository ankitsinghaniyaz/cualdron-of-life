We all know the story of the clever crow who used stones to get access to deep water in the earthen pot but what if I say that it's not the complete story? What if it was the utopic version of an utter disaster? And his cleverness the cause of his death?

The crow, albeit clever, and with a good intension started dropping stones in the pot. When he saw the water level rise he was ecstatic. He was very thirsty but now that was not important.
The adrenalin rush of having used his brain to get access to something that no one else could was giving him joy. He was enjoying himself and then he obsessed and here is his downfall.

Are we all not like the thirsty crow? We all need(yes need) some earthly wealth and fame but eventually, when we stumble upon it we forget the real reason we started. We wanted to take a sip of the elixir and enjoy and be on our way but that's not what happens. The thirst that could have been quenched in a sip is now pitless and neverending.

I can only admire the human brains that perfected the art of storytelling because it's a form of discourse which doesn't need explicit pointers and course correction. Though there can be nothing like a story to get the point across. That's why we find stories in all forms of literature and religious books.

On the same note, I would like to share the story of [Robin Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/locaterobin/?originalSubdomain=in) of [Peepal Farm](https://peepalfarm.org). I feel very inspired by his story as it's as real as it gets. I believe in seeing people who have done things and tried things I wish I could. And this is one person. Check out his [life story](https://m.facebook.com/video_redirect/?src=https%3A%2F%2Fvideo-maa2-1.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fv%2Ft42.9040-2%2F10000000_311280370046252_1212331417280855866_n.mp4%3F_nc_cat%3D109%26_nc_sid%3D985c63%26efg%3DeyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImxlZ2FjeV9zZCJ9%26_nc_ohc%3D7_XCcAIKO7oAX9JBL7T%26_nc_ht%3Dvideo-maa2-1.xx%26oh%3D9a7141b2556b051e6344194bf8370c17%26oe%3D5EF782CC&source=misc&id=870475816777473&noredirect=0&watermark=0&refid=52&__tn__=FH-R) and I bet you would not have wasted your time. :)
