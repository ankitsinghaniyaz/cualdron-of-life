I bet we have all heard the saying 'Honesty is the best policy'. But have we ever wondered why? It might seem like unconsequential when we are not honest but deep within our consiousness we pay a very heavy price.

First and foremost I think it's about being true to oneself. If we are not honest then our lens are painted in the same light and we come to believe no body around us is honest. Causing huge trust issues and metal conflict.
