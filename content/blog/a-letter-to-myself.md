Dear Ankit,

I know that you are doing great in your life. The numbers are moving fast, the numbers of age, money and mistakes. I also congratulate you for all the hardships and struggles that you have overcome. Come on, I know you want to believe that it was nothing and people have worse and I agree. But that won't mean that what you have achieved was easy. Applaud for your efforts even when many of them might have failed. Thank yourself for trying out new things and having the courage to work on your inner self with the highest priority.

You are a very strong person today and not many things can hurt you or your peace. But there are things and people you hold very dear. I can even say that they have/had the key to your happiness. And don't let yourself think that it was wrong or right. We are just talking about what is, not trying to judge or change anything right now. A person you loved dearly changed and cheated on you and that has hurt you. You are over it today but it has caused so much I've been with you when you were fighting it off. Great job buddy! You still miss them at times but now you are wise, you know it was toxic and they do not belong to a world where you reside. And you cannot afford to go where they are. It must have been hard for you to accept that they are not going to be a part of it anymore but I know that you firmly believe in the good that's yet to come. Someone whose frequency matches yours and the one who will make you want to be a better person. Do not rush and take your time, good things take time.

Of course, there were mistakes that you made and you should be forgiven for them. We both know you never wanted to hurt anyone and the intention is what matters. Though there were times when some selfish emotions got the better of you but relax, it's human to make mistakes. I remember you having cried and paying heavily for them as well. So why bother to keep the guilt hanging? You have learnt the lesson those mistakes were created for. You are a better version of yourself today.

I'm here for you no matter if it's dark or sunny. I will hold your hands always and forever. Hug you when you feel down and dance beside you while no one watches us in our privacy. Smile - because no one does it better than you. :)

Yours truely,

Ankit
