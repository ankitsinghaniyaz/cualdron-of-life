There are lot of emotions that I am going through. I believed myself to be very strong but that doesn't look like the case. I feel bad and I suffer too. These pains and problems I'm talking about are my own creations.

Feeling bad when I see someone I love(or loved) do things that I don't confirm with. This can be as a lover, a spouse, a parent or a sibling. Everyone is different and they have their own idea of the world. The problem arise when they don't confirm to my so called principals.

The first problem is about clothing. I like and ogle girls who wear short dresses. I find it pretty attractive but I don't want my girlfriend or my sister to wear the same. I know I'm so bad. But I'm here to say the truth. That is how I feel and I know it can be wrong. The problem may not be with the dress. Dressing in a fashion is personal choice and cannot be linked to ethics or moral values but my mind finds it co-related. And I don't want my loved ones to be bad. They are the best people in my life. I might be possessive or jealous or even uneducated, not sure on this one.

You know what is funny? Few moments back the thing that was so grave now looks stupid to me. To such an extent that I feel the whole idea is rubbish but it is also true that just some time back I was cringing and crying about that shit. Weird!
