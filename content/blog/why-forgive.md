Yesterday I visited Nandi Hill, a very beautiful place with clouds below your eyes. Small hills rising above the clouds as if cutting through them. If not for those hills the sky feels like another sea of white foam and water. I love to travel and I love it even more so for the insights and observations we make when travelling.

This time the wisdom is about forgiveness. It's even stranger when I think what made me think about forgiveness and it was rudeness. Have you ever wondered why Jesus never confronted Judas even when he was well aware of what was going to happen? Or why Ram never had any hard feeling for Kaikeyi when she sends him to exile for no wrong? Or why Yusuf even as a king forgave his brothers for the years of suffering they brought upon him?

I see a pearl of very profound wisdom here which tells us about what real forgiveness, mercy and compassion is. When we say, someone, to be our own then we don't break relations for the bad and mistakes they do. Instead, we have a loving attitude towards them, try to understand what made them do such a bad action. People are not naturally evil. Our emotions combined with our surroundings and past experiences make us compulsively behave in a certain way which others may not like. The person may not like the same behaviour himself or he may be unaware that he is behaving in such a hurtful way.

This is not to say that you won't feel bad, you definitely will. What we should do is talk about our feeling in the kindest possible way. I believe three things should never be held within and should be expressed with humility.

1. Sorry - when you wrong someone
2. Hurt - when someone hurts you
3. Love - when you really love someone let them know

I'm lucky that I'm surrounded by very nice people around me. I just pray for the strength and courage it takes for forgive and express my feelings. For life is short and the time is fleeting...
