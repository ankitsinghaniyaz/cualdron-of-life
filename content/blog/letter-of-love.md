Hello Pikachu,

Do you know a sure way to tell if someone is in love? In love, a person becomes hopelessly romantic and crave a medium to let it out. They express their emotions through poetry, songs and letters and I'm writing this to you.

You are the ~~piece~~ peace of me that I've been looking for. I've been blessed with an almost perfect life and you just took away the almost. Maybe it was my heart that didn't let it be perfect? Or maybe it was yours that was designed to fit in that cage better? I don't know but you did well, taking mine away and leaving me yours.

If I were to judge you, I cannot give you anything less then a 10 on 10, but you are beyond. Beyond any rating system can capture, you are divine. Your simplicity paired with your style and your silliness paired with your integrity is a combination for which heaven will fight. And I don't know if I deserve someone as beautiful as you. You accepted me with all my flaws without an iota of doubt and trusted me with all your might when I found it hard to trust myself. You signed yourself up to deal with insecurities which I find impossible to fight. You showed me what love should feel like and what it's like to be treated right. You made this dry fountain jump back to life.

All I want to do is love you for the rest of my life, put that anklet in your feet every time you get ready and kiss you good night. You will be always my priority and I promise to be there for you all the time. This is my letter of love to you and it shall always remind me of the love we share. <3
