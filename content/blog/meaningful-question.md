Question is undoubtedly the most powerful tool in the quiver of an inquisitive person. It is like a shovel using which we dig the dirt of ignorance and try to understand reality. It is also the torch we point towards the pit to better see in the darkness of falsehood. It is the chisel we use to carve our own personality. The way we question reality, nature and anything around, shapes our complete being. Buddha asked if sickness, old age and death would reach him? Newton asked why the apple fell down from the tree? A child asked why the star shines and how is there water inside the coconut?


Question is also a thread that pulls us closer to our own self and others. I believe asking one meaningful question a day can make such a huge impact on our lives and relationships. It could be anything, doesn't matter but what is important is the genuine desire to know and learn. The question could be asked to one's own self or to another person who really matters in your life.

Asking question makes you think. In order to ask a meaningful question we think about so many things like what we already know, what we want to know, is the question offensive and what is the right way to ask that and so much more.

We might not have new questions every day but we will surely have so much to ask if we are willing to put in the effort. To answer a good question is not easy, the other person needs to be invested too for the communication to be meaningful. A mother asks his child about his meal every day and it has the same sincerity it had the first time. I think having such people around us who want to learn about us and our well being is a really important aspect of our life. One reason why we need a social life is to be able to know more and express our own self. It's very fulfilling when two people can have such a meaningful conversation.

I've had the pleasure to meet such beautiful souls in my life. With them, I've had talks of my life which didn't let me sleep at night and smile in the darkness of my unlit room. These are the people who make me wake up with a smile and look forward to another day. Thank you, everyone, for being a part of my life. :)
