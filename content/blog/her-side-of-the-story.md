I shared [my side of the story](/blog/when-i-hurt). How I feel the pain and cheated but I know mistakes were made from my side as well. I might not be able to do all the justice to her feelings but trying to say everything that she made me known.

I don't want to write much concrete details here but the lines below should be enough to tell you my flaws.

You told them everything, <br/>
And called me names,<br/>
But did you forget about your games?<br/>

How you were busy,<br/>
With office and work, like you said,<br/>
I was waiting,<br/>
For the call you never made.<br/>

I've caught you lying,<br/>
Breaking promise once again,<br/>
Nights I've cried,<br/>
But you are still the same.<br/>

I guess you took me for granted,<br/>
Or you thought we were that close?<br/>
I fell you never understood,<br/>
my pain and my woes.<br/>

Distance between us and people trying to probe,<br/>
I felt a wind of change,<br/>
and alas the love is all gone.<br/>

You think all sacrifices are yours,<br/>
My challenges were small and old.<br/>
Life of a girl has always been so frail,<br/>
Do you still think that my love was fake?<br/>
