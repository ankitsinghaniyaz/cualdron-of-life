The title can mean different things to different people. For me, the only fortune is my time and love. My firm belief is that we love without expectations and I am the one who needs my love the most.

We all have limited energy on any given day and to invest it on someone who doesn't give a damn about you is not a great way to spend it. I love you and I always will and that's not going to change. But if what you bring on the table is selfishness and only concern about yourself, that's a bad vibe. I am there for you when you need me and time gets hard and I've always been. But I'm not going to run after you, chase you and be constantly present, to be drained of my energy. I'm going to prioritize my peace and work on being happy myself first before I help anyone else. And if this hurts your feeling, fuck you!

It's a very fine line and the difference can be blurry but I've learned that balance is the key to anything. Extremism is easy to achieve but not sustainable.

> Extremism is easy but balance is the key!

What I propose for myself is that I am going to cut off if you are being a parasite and sucking me out of energy. Though that doesn't mean I'm not there for you. I'll be your friend always and I'm genuinely going to listen to you. Give you my suggestions, if you would like me to, and help you through your thicks and thins.

We all have preferences. We seek someone when we are happy and we seek someone else when we are sad and that's very weird. How twisted is the fact that we share our happiness with a person with whom we don't share our pain? A friend who shoulders our pain deserves to be on the frontline in our limelight.

Love yourself and stay rooted in your gut feeling. Have compassion for your troubles like you would have it for a friend's. After all, we are humans and humans are not meant to be perfect. You deserve those kind encouraging words more than anyone else.

There is a huge storm brewing and everyone is trying to hold the line. Move forward inch by inch. Do not leave anyone behind not yourself either. :)
