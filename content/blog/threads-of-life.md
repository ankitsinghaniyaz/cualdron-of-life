We all know so many people around and we think and treat each of them differently. We have different roles to play. I think the thread and the life are very much related. I find them a lot more similar than distinct.

Everyone is connected to every other person via a thread so fragile yet so powerful. Consider a man seeing a woman suffering from a severe chronic disease. They don't know if they will even see the next day. Both the person try to live happily and a very simple and drama free life. What is happening here is that the thread is always fragile and in this relation the parties realize this. They realize how delicate and uncertain life is. Just like a bubble in the water, which burst into nothingness without any warnings.

There are times when we forget about this thread and start to think about the two ends connected via the thread. This will bring us suffering, separation and pain. You see this is what we would call ego or self-centric behaviour. Every human being is different but when we think about the thread joining us and we value that link more than the entities connected via it. I call this `Oneness`. This is what coming together and getting dissolved in each other is.

This thread joining us needs constant care. We nourish it with honesty, love and sacrifices. The thread becomes weak when we provide the wrong nutrition. When we envy, doubt and lie we provide all the right ingredients to break it.

No thread once broken can be joined in the same way it used to be, just like a river you see under your eyes is not that same at any moment. Joins are painful but a part of life. In Japan people glue together the broken crockery using gold, just to remember that everything breaks and change but thing that was once broken is now something different but more beautiful.

Every human being is connected with so many other beings at a time that the world is like a rainbow colour blanked. With some of our threads red with the colour of love and with some yellow for the colour of friendship. While with others we have the white thread of higher bond and with some, we darken them to no ends. It is our responsibility to keep our world lively with colours and fill in the right shades in our own life. We are the master craftsman of our own life, we decide what we weave!
