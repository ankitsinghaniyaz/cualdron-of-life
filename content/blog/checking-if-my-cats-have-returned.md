My life was marching on its comfortable path every day when some kittens came to my life. I would give milk to their mother, try to touch the kittens only when the mom was not there and keep smiling. The kittens grow fast and now they run and play. Only one thing hasn't changed their mission to not come near me and my desire to hold the soft fur balls. It's been almost perfect but perfect doesn't last long. Things seem so perfect at times but then again in this world only change is permanent.

One day I see one of the kittens missing and my heart pounds, where could she have been? A variety of questions were colliding my consciousness. Could someone have stolen her from me? Or did her mother naturally took her away? Of course, I tried what I could but the question remains. I was sad for a while but then life couldn't care less about the missing kitten and other duties had to be done and thus the life moved on. As I got engaged in my daily chores the ache in my heart and the revolting thoughts subsided and things felt normal. In the evening I went to check again and she was back, I couldn't care any more where should have gone. All I knew was that she is with me right now.

Things kept moving smoothly for a while, I increased my frequency of checks lest someones steal her again from me, I stopped taking her for granted. Now again on one chilly evening, all of my kittens are missing and I don't know where to find them. Would they ever come back? I cannot say. Will they remember me and my love? I don't know. Will they care for me the same way I did for them? None of these questions can be answered. I would now go to the spot where the kittens were in the hope that they might come back but that never happens.

This not just a story about my kittens. It about relationships. This is about two lovers who are now distant, this is about a child who misses his father and this is about the mother who wails for her lost child. This is all of us. We have all loved and lost but we all have hope. True love is hopeful! We know things can change, it's never too late. The farmer keeps waiting for the rain to return and the sky is where he often looks at. His life is complete and things are ok still he will always look to the skies.

And I still keep checking if my cats have returned.
