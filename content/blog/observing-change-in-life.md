> There is nothing permanent except change. - Heraclitus

The statement above is so true and powerful. If we think carefully we will realize that everything changes. Weather, situations, people, position, wealth and anything else for that matter.

When we know that everything changes the way we interact with the world will change. We get attached to people and they change now it breaks your expectations. The change was just hidding behind the door. We just failed to acknowledge it. If a person is not doing the right things today but you know things change for sure. You will never give up on the person and be hopeful that things will better.

> The certainity of change empowers us with hope and detachment. Change also means the life of the entity is very uncertain, so live to the fullest.

This realization dawned upon me when I was seeing the behaviour of my friend change. These are just my observation and there could be more things that effects his behaviour but these are my feelings. I've learned one things don't hold back your feelings. Just speak the truth out in the right tone with a good intenation and it's all fine.
