I ask this question so frequently to myself and the answers vary between I don't know and I've everything. Just take a brief moment to think how blessed that moment is when you are able to say that you are happy with what you have? I firmly believe that I'm very lucky and I've a lot that many people don't. But you can also say that I don't have so much that other people have? I don't care though, really. I do care sometimes but then I know it's ok as I've more than I need.

If you can say 'I don't need anything', just congratulate yourself that how blessed you are. Not many people in this world are in this state of the mind. We are always chasing after things. The next gadget, the next dress, the next destination or the next relationship. Hold on! Calm down and take a look at things you have and make yourself known about the extent of blessings you have. You have a family which many don't. You don't worry where your next meal is going to come from. You have all your body parts functioning. You are alive and breathing. It is more about the perspective and understanding than really having something. The list of what you can have is infinite but so is the list of what you already have. It's a line stretching infinitely on both the ends. We stand at the centre and make a choice and look at whatever direction we desire to.

Now that I know this, it doesn't mean that I won't desire again. That's never going to happen, don't even bother trying that. It is a human tendency to lean towards the beautiful, rare and enjoyable things. What instead you do is not attach yourself too tightly with them. It's good if you have them but it's fine if you don't. Having the same response to opposite extreme situations is a nature we need to cultivate.

Let's take an example. I'm very fond of good clothing, it need not be branded but the quality has to be good and I need to like the style. Though often these traits happen to be found in branded clothes (cry). Here's the question. Can you share and give away your best shirt to your friend or anyone random? If you answer no then you should ask why? I bet there won't be any satisfactory answer. It is selfishness at highest and attachment at its worst. The more valuable, likeable and important we think something to be. The more we stick to that thing. Our feelings and emotions are very strongly coupled with that particular thing.

Let's say I have 3 cars. One refurbished Tata Indica, a brand new Volkswagon Polo GT TSI and another almost new BMW X1. You hear someone scratched your car. Thought of which car races to your mind first? Which of them will make your heart race fastest?

These are very silly but life-changing examples we all go through daily. They have the power to change our life if we pay enough attention. I believe improving oneself is the best thing we can do in life and what could be better than fixing our selfishness and unending desires. I have so much in my life and so do you. :)
