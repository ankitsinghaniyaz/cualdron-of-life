October is ending today and winter is at the door. I cannot say *Winter is coming* as now it's more like a trademark. Its been a while since I've been home. Hyderabad is good to me but there is no place which can be like home. The sense of security and peace just by seeing your father and mother cannot be expressed. I feel like I am once again a child like those good old days. Those days where we used to get hurt a little, think a little less and smile a bit more. If I had to stay somewhere that would be my in my moms lap and under my fathers eyes. I've named the title as **The Beginning** but I don't know what's to be written. So I just thought there's no better way to start then express my gratitude to all, who touched my life and gave a difference essence to it. Last week I travelled to Kerala, which is titled as God's own country. It was a journey that spanned over 7 days and it was really nice to be there. 

In my coming post I will like to talk about my jourey to Kerala and how my experience was. The clean climate, the friendly people, the clever monkeys, the costly coconut, the beautiful sunset and a lot more. For today I am going to close here. I hope I keep coming back and post more. :)
