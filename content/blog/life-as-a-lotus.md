Living in this world, accepting our part from the society and taking part in the events of our life while still not being attached. This is what I believe is the right way to live. Just like a lotus in the middle of a pond, taking nourishment from the very depths of the water, adding to the beauty of the surrounding yet ever untouched by the water and mud around.

This is what is the middle path or the balanced life. Where you don't move to any extreme. You don't give up everything but don't indulge yourself.
