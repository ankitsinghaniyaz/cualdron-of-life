A happy couple was living in the fast-moving city of Bangalore. They would work hard every day in the cubicle. They took pride in what they did but there were days when nothing seemed right. All the efforts they put felt useless. While there were days when everything looked perfect and today was such a day.

They have bought their first car. Working in a day job, living in a big city and owning a car seems like a dream for a middle-class family. And yes, of course, it includes putting in sick leaves on a lazy day, exploring the best brews in the town and going for a drive to the one favourite Maggie shop.

The hawker was situated in a fairly secluded corner of the street and that was something which stood out about him. He could have easily been a part of the shiniest street corners but he was of the elite and choose to do business with the like. The business was fair and things were working.

Today was a regular day and business was okay but we all know that we have a graph in our mind. We all are analysts in our own right and know the ebbs and tides. He almost knew how much more he had to make to call it a good day. When his regular happy couple arrived, even happier in their shining silver Toyota. He too was happy. He made them the regular and closed for the day. The couple drove back smiling and the hawker reached home happy. :)

Happiness is such a wonderful thing and every human being deserves a piece of it. It's just amazing how we all are connected with one another and influence everything around us.
