Hope is the remedy world advocates to all the problems in life. How could ever being optimistic be a bad thing? I am a firm believer that optimism can solve almost all our problems, but recently I found out that maybe sometimes it's okay to lose hope. Excess of anything is not good so is true with hope. If you ever become so hopelessly hopeful about an event happening you will overpower your intelligence and instinct and stay in limbo wondering about things that might never happen.

I think people who suffer from this condition have a tough time letting go. They are hopeful, always, and that's what makes it deadly. But can our hope change an event? Maybe but maybe not! Hope is best paired with action much like how tea is paired to the biscuit. Wishful thinking is fine till we can influence the chance. The moment you are out of the equation, it's time for you to dump the wish.

Do not think that I'm asking us to not hope. I cannot imagine a life without hope. But placing our hopes in the right place can do wonders. A simple example would be - I hope that I'll exercise and stay fit vs I hope that somehow I'll be fit. Almost the same but very different! I hope that I pause and think lest I become hopelessly hopeful...
