When I look back to the things I've done I feel so selfish. I know there has to be a line between not doing anything to giving away your everything but now that I see I wish I could have done a little more. We are all born alone and we are destined to die that way. The only time we can be with someone is in between these two stations. I want to stop being so concerned and know that the journey is short and people will depart for their destination and we will not be together sometime very soon. This sense of ending brings so much gratitude in me which I want to express. This is for all the people who walk in that extra mile just be with me and help me. There is no one as important as you in my life.

Starting from my parents, siblings, family, school buddies, college friends and my colleagues and people I've met by sheer chance. I'm blessed to have you all in my life. I know you are not perfect and I see your faults but I know neither am I and you still put up with me.

Sometimes I wonder what is the purpose of this life and I don't have a good answer to that but I know something. I know that holding on to my loved ones in times of flood and drought will a part of that purpose. What else is this life without you? Aren't the memories hollow when you are not in them. When I travel it's not the place that is important. The place becomes important because I'm with you.

This is a note to myself for the day when life brings the test of arrogance to my door and I shall remember that only you are my precious.
